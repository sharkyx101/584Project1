# 584Project1
Michael Sanati's Project 1 for 584:

Backend: Flask with python was used for functionality and I used MongoDB to store the database of the tasks/comments (comments were set as an array within each task). To run the flask server, you need to run the backend.py within the parent directory of the react project.

Frontend: React (javascript) was used and you just need to run "npm start" within the parent directory. Source code of frontend is in App.js. 

Huge note - If you want to actually run the app on your own computer, you need to intialize a react app folder that contains the necessary dependencies. The App.js should be located within your src folder and the backend.py should just be within the project folder. Otherwise, please watch the video demo for demonstraiton on how to start up app and see it in action.
