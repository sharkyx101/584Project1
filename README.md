# 584Project1
Michael Sanati's Project 1 for 584:

Backend: Flask with python was used for functionality and I used MongoDB to store the database of the tasks/comments (comments were set as an array within each task). To run the flask server, you need to run the backend.py within the parent directory of the react project.

Frontend: React was used and you just need to run "npm start" within the parent directory.
